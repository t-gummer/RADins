# RADins package development

## Purpose

The `dev` folder of this package is not included in the build of the R
package. It is a place where the development of new ideas for the
package can be explored.

<!-- TO DO: -->

<!-- add a description of how the JSON and HTML data were obtained. -->

## Shortcuts

The shortcuts folder in this directory is for reverse engineering IDs
for RStudio shortcuts.

## To do

  - Fix the `set keyboard shortcuts` Add-in
  - Add a open file path Add-in that allows you to open the file/folder
    in the current cursor position (use `file.edit()` for files and
    somehow open the file explorer at that path for other paths).

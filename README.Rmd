# fwdSlash

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

The `fwdSlash` package provides an RStudio add-in that replaces all backslashes (`\`) in text copied to the clipboard to forwardslashes (`/`). It also provides a selection of other add-ins that either read or write the clipboard while changing some slashes within it (see `help("paste_add-ins")` and `help("copy_add-ins")`).

You can use this to paste file paths from Windows File Explorer into RStudio and have them work as files straight away. Use them immediately without having to do a _find and replace_ (or worse, manually replace all the backslashes with forward slashes).


## Installation

You can install the fwdSlash (and it's associated add-in) from [GitHub](https://github.com/t-gummer/fwdSlash) with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")  #In case you have not installed it.
devtools::install_github("t-gummer/fwdSlash")
```
## Workflow

It is recommended that you set the fwdSlash `Special paste (\ to /)` add-in as a keyboard shortcut to allow for easy access. `Ctrl+Shift+V` is recommended (note it's similarity to `Ctrl+V`).

* [Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts)


<!-- There is a function in the fwdSlash package that allows you to easily change the RStudio keyboard shortcut _programmatically_ as an alternative to clicking through menus. -->

## Compatability

While the add-in was designed with Windows in mind, this packages also has the potential to work on other operating systems by vitue of the [`clipr`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/clipr) package. It's utility on Mac and Linux is reduced due the fact that their file paths use forwardslashes and by default which makes copied file paths already compatable immediately in R.
